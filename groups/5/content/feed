    <title>PACE-Net Plus: a bridge over europe and the pacific region for science, technology and innovation</title>
    <link>http://plus.pacenet.eu/news/pace-net-plus-bridge-over-europe-and-pacific-region-science-technology-and-innovation-2016</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-date field-type-datetime field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2016-12-23T00:00:00+11:00&quot;&gt;Friday, 23 December 2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunities for European and Pacific researchers to collaborate are many and diverse. The European Union (EU) policies and scientific strategies aim at reinforcing these collaboration opportunities, notably through Horizon 2020, the European framework programme dedicated to research and innovation. Strengthening the Europe-Pacific bi-regional dialogue in science, technology and innovation (ST&amp;I) is a key step in achieving increased collaboration towards the societal challenges identi ed in Horizon 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compendium presents the outcomes of PACE-NET Plus, a project funded by the European Commission (EC) under the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Framework Programme, which united 16 partners in the Pacific and the EU, coordinated by the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD), to strengthen ST&amp;I cooperation between the Pacific island countries and Europe. This partnership involved a comprehensive collection of Pacific and European ST&amp;I actors, including institutions from the two largest Pacific players, Australia and New Zealand, the French overseas countries and territories (New Caledonia and French Polynesia), European countries, Pacific island countries (Samoa, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea), international multilateral institutions and Pacific regional bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project promoted the integration of the Pacific region and its interests into a number of EC roadmaps and actions. One of the core missions of PACE- NET Plus was to raise the visibility of the Pacific within the EU. In particular, this included the EC Directorates-General for Research and Innovation and for International Cooperation and Development, through illuminating the role of ST&amp;I for development aid and better governance. Also included was the European Exterior Action Service, through “science diplomacy”. Conversely, PACE-NET Plus also aimed at assisting greater integration of EU activities into the research and development policies of the Pacific countries. The project was also a signi cant contributor to a bi-regional dialogue between the two regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PACE-NET Plus analysis of the research priorities of mutual interests for Europe and the Pacific highlighted three major societal challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Health, demographic change and wellbeing&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research, and the bioeconomy&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Climate action, environment, resource e ciency and raw materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST&amp;I approaches play an important role in assisting Pacific nations to address these challenges which, compounded by geographic and socio-economic issues unique to the region, are also key developmental priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions taken by PACE-NET Plus in the perspective of these multiple expectations are presented in this document. Also presented are major policy recommendations of the project, in collaboration with in uential Pacific regional bodies, such as the need to institutionalize the dialogue for ST&amp;I between the Europe and Pacific. We also suggest the launch of two concrete support actions: the  rst one dedicated to a multidisciplinary call for research (based on the PACE-Net Plus seed funding scheme) in order to stimulate cooperation between the PICTs, and with the European and Pacific larger countries (this call is endorsed by the ACP Secretary); the second action is dedicated to climate science through an interdisciplinary “observatory system of climate change and its impacts in the Pacific” (a pilot project on this topic was presented to the European Parliament and we are hopeful that it will be initiated during 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of IRD, the coordinator of this project, we would like to wholeheartedly thank our partners as well as the three members of our External Advisory Board (Dr Raghunath Ghodake, APAARI; Dr Geo roy Lamarche, NIWA; and Dr Christophe Yvetot, UNIDO) for their deep and fruitful involvement in PACE-Net Plus, which has allowed us all to carry out this project successfully, and to surpass our goals. We would also like to sincerely thank the European Commission, particularly Mr. Armand Beuf, our scientific offcer for his e cient and benevolent support for PACE-NET Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the 16 partners of the PACE-NET Plus Consortium, we would also like to thank all those who took part in this network and dialogue and supported us in one way or another. We very much hope that the growing research community that we have mobilized together during the 3 last years in the region and in Europe, will remain ready to continue this regional and bi-regional cooperation and dialogue, while contributing to the well-being of Pacific and EU citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-website field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Further information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/system/files/documents/PNP_Compendium.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://plus.pacenet.eu/system/files/documents/PNP_Compendium.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp1&quot;&gt;WP1 Health, Demographic Change and Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp2&quot;&gt;WP2 Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry, Marine and Maritime and Inland Water Research, and the Bioeconomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp3&quot;&gt;WP3 Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp4&quot;&gt;WP4 Cooperation on Innovation Issues to Tackle the Societal Challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp6&quot;&gt;WP6 Bi-regional Policy Dialogue in ST&amp;amp;I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;PACE-Net Plus: a bridge over europe and the pacific region for science, technology and innovation&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Research at the forefront of the global race for sustainable development, says UNESCO report</title>
    <link>http://plus.pacenet.eu/news/research-forefront-global-race-sustainable-development-says-unesco-report-2016</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-date field-type-datetime field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2015-11-10T00:00:00+11:00&quot;&gt;Tuesday, 10 November 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most countries, regardless of their level of income, now see research and innovation as key to fostering sustainable economic growth and furthering their development. This is one of the conclusions of the UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the wake of the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals to 2030 by the United Nations General Assembly, the UNESCO Science Report clearly shows that research is both a motor for economic development and a cornerstone in the construction of societies that are more sustainable and more respectful of the planet,” said the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Report’s first lesson is that, despite the economic crisis that hit industrialized countries in 2008, gross domestic expenditure on research and development (GERD) increased globally by 31% between 2007 and 2013, rising from USD 1,132 billion in 2007 to USD 1,478 billion in 2013. This increase was more rapid than that of global gross domestic product (GDP) during the same period (20%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USA still leads, with 28% of global investment in R&amp;D, followed by China (20%) – now ahead of the European Union (19%) – and Japan (10%). The rest of the world represents 67% of the global population but just 23% of global investment in R&amp;D. Nevertheless, research investment by countries such as Brazil, India and Turkey is increasing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in R&amp;D spending owes a great deal to the private sector, which has compensated for frozen or reduced public spending in a number of industrialized countries, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and France. This trend is particularly apparent in Canada (whose world share of R&amp;D spending dropped from 2.1% in 2007 to 1.5% in 2013) and Australia, where significant cuts were made to research funding and applied sciences were prioritized to the detriment of basic research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, say the authors of the report, basic research does not only generate new knowledge; it also contributes to the quality of higher education. In the long term, the balance of funding between applied and basic research can also affect the pace at which knowledge spreads. The Green Revolution, which enabled a significant increase in global agricultural output starting in the 1950s, drew almost entirely on research by public sector laboratories and universities. The picture is very different today, with advances in genetics and biotechnology largely coming out of private companies that are much more protective of their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If global spending on R&amp;D has increased despite the economic crisis, it is largely because it has been identified as a key factor in promoting economic growth and development. As a result, a great many countries, regardless of the size of their income, now see research and innovation as a way to keep up in a highly competitive world or find their place in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the case in Africa, where there is growing recognition that the development of modern infrastructure, such as hospitals, roads, railways, etc., and a more diversified economy require investment in science and technology, as well as the constitution of a skilled workforce. Kenya, for example, devoted 0.79% of its GDP to R&amp;D in 2010 compared to just 0.36% in 2007. R&amp;D spending is also increasing in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of increased R&amp;D investment, technologies fostering sustainable development are an emerging priority for a number of countries, which fits with the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in September 2015. This is especially the case in Latin America where 19 countries have adopted policies in favour of renewable energy. Uruguay intends to generate 90% of its electricity from renewable sources by the end of 2015. Chile and Mexico have significantly increased their wind and solar energy production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar projects are being undertaken in the Arab States. Morocco, for example, inaugurated Africa’s largest wind farm in 2014 and is developing what could turn out to be Africa’s biggest solar farm. In 2015, Saudi Arabia announced a programme to develop solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in research also translates into an increase in the number of scientists, estimated at 7.8 million worldwide, which is up by more than 20% since 2007. The European Union has the most (22% of the world share), followed by China (19%) and USA (16.7%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has also been a parallel explosion in the number of scientific publications, which have increased by 23% since 2008. In 2014 there were around 1.27 million per month. Europe also leads in this field (34% of world share), followed by the USA (25%), although their respective shares have seen a slight decrease. The number of publications coming out of China has almost doubled in five years, achieving nearly 20% of the world total, compared to 5% ten years ago. This demonstrates the maturity of the Chinese research system in terms of investments, number of researchers and publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as being more numerous, scientists are also more mobile. Despite the development of the Internet and the multiplication of online networks, doctoral-level researchers still feel the need to travel. The increasing mobility of PhD students in turn influences the mobility of researchers. “This is perhaps one of the most important trends of recent times,” say the authors of the Report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students from the Arab States, Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe are the most likely to study abroad. Europe and North America are still the preferred destinations for students. The USA alone receives almost half (49%) of international students enrolled in doctoral science or engineering courses. The United Kingdom comes second (9%), followed by France (7%) and Australia (4.6%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the economic crisis of 2008, Europe and North America have lost some of their attraction. Meanwhile, students who wish to study abroad now have a wider choice. South Africa hosted about 60,000 international students in 2009. Cuba is one of the most popular destinations for students from Latin America, attracting 17,000 from the continent, compared to 5,000 who study in Brazil and 2000 in Chile. Another example is Malaysia, which expects to become the sixth most popular destination for international students by 2020. From 2007 to 2012, the number of international students in Malaysia almost doubled to 56,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even countries suffering from brain drain are now attracting researchers. Sudan, for example, lost 3,000 researchers who went to neighbouring countries where conditions are better, notably Ethiopia, between 2002 and 2014. But Sudan also became a host country for students from the Arab world and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While, globally, women have achieved parity at Master’s level, their share diminishes at PhD level to 43% of all doctoral graduates. The gap continues to widen after this, as women only represent 28.4% of the world’s researchers. They also have more limited access to funding than men and are less well represented in prestigious universities. They remain a minority in senior positions, whether on faculty boards or at the higher levels of decision-making in universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regions with the greatest number of women researchers are Southeast Europe (49%), the Caribbean, Central Asia and Latin America (44%). Interestingly, in the Arab States 37% of researchers are women, which is a higher proportion than in the European Union (33%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of countries have put in place policies to reverse this trend. In 2013 Germany, for example, introduced a 30% quota for women on corporate boards of directors. Japan’s selection criteria for large university grants also seek to increase the representation of women among teaching staff and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Formulating a successful national science and innovation policy remains a very difficult task”, conclude the authors of the report. This will require simultaneous action on several fronts, whether it is education, basic research, technological development or indeed private investment in R&amp;D. The 2008 economic crisis, which made many industrialized countries tighten their budgets, has rendered this task even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most R&amp;D takes place in high-income countries, innovation is now occurring in a large number of countries, whatever their income level. Some innovation is occurring without any R&amp;D activity at all. The authors of the report therefore encourage policy makers not to focus exclusively on designing corporate incentives for R&amp;D, but also to target innovation, in the form of technology transfer and the acquisition of machinery, equipment and software, which are all key elements in the innovation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most science policies advocate stronger links between the private sector, universities and public research institutions, these commitments often come to nothing, the report observes, quoting a 2013 survey carried out by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics in 65 countries. The report encourages policy makers to draft strategies to try to reverse this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UNESCO Science Report also emphasises the importance of good governance for innovation-driven development. Corruption in the university system is an obstacle to the education of qualified graduates. It is also a disincentive for the private sector. Companies will have little interest in investing in R&amp;D if they cannot rely on the justice system to defend their intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UNESCO Science Report is prepared by a team of international experts. It presents a picture of the trends in global research and development, based on a wealth of qualitative and quantitative data. The report is divided into chapters focusing on different regions (including the Pacific, and included references to PACE-Net Plus), presenting new insights into some countries and essays on specific themes, such as the role of indigenous knowledge. The UNESCO Science Report is published every five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-website field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Further information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.unesco.org/unesco_science_report/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://en.unesco.org/unesco_science_report/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp1&quot;&gt;WP1 Health, Demographic Change and Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp2&quot;&gt;WP2 Food Security, Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry, Marine and Maritime and Inland Water Research, and the Bioeconomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp3&quot;&gt;WP3 Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Research at the forefront of the global race for sustainable development, says UNESCO report&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>The Pacific region is a perfect example of science diplomacy in action</title>
    <link>http://plus.pacenet.eu/news/pacific-region-perfect-example-science-diplomacy-action-2016</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-date field-type-datetime field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;date-display-single&quot; property=&quot;dc:date&quot; datatype=&quot;xsd:dateTime&quot; content=&quot;2016-11-22T00:00:00+11:00&quot;&gt;Tuesday, 22 November 2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pacific region can serve as an exemplar of how science diplomacy could work, according to Professor Jean-François Marini, coordinator of the EU-funded PACE-Net Plus project and former adviser to the French government on science diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PACE-Net Plus united 16 partners in the Pacific and the EU to strengthen research cooperation between the two regions. How did you go about achieving this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘In order to reach this objective of a better, stronger cooperation in science, technology and innovation, the philosophy was to increase research capacity, management and dialogue, to allow the appropriation of science by the countries of the region. One of the ideas was to make information available to the Pacific states to help them to form opinions, founded on scientific evidence, and for Europe to better know the opportunities in Pacific research. At PACE-Net Plus, we have sent our recommendations to the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) asking the leaders of the member countries of the region to recognise the importance of science for development, and to raise its visibility among the leaders of the Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘One of the outcomes that emerged is the idea that an observatory of climate change in the Pacific region would be a good tool to help ensure that scientific knowledge serves local governance. We also think, and this is important, that each country in the region should have a scientific coordinator, or a chief scientist, a function that is often still lacking.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;What can Europe learn by working with the Pacific states?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘With climate change, emerging diseases affect more people in the Pacific and could easily become a concern in Europe. Pacific countries are also starting to think about environmental migration as the water level rise forces some islands to evacuate. There are also a number of issues that concern this region which will become global in the future, such as deep sea mining and blue growth (sustainable exploitation of ocean resources), to name just a few.’&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;You were working alongside the European External Action Service, Europe’s diplomatic corps. What was the reason for this?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘In the framework of our bi-regional platforms, we worked closely with the European External Action Service because, over and above science, scientific projects such as PACE-Net Plus are also a tool of diplomatic relations between the two regions.’&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;How does capacity building in science help form diplomatic relations?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘In big international fora, for example, the Pacific islands are more our partners than opponents. They take part, for example, in open discussions to agree on 1, 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius as a tolerance threshold of temperature rise for all countries in the future. This relationship with the countries of the region based on science facilitates the discussion on these global issues.’&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;How did you go about building this relationship during the PACE-Net Plus project?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘In the field of climate change, for example, our thematic think tanks allowed country representatives to look at science as a development tool, to ensure that the decisions around climate are based on rigorous facts. As many of these countries deal with the reality of rising sea levels, science gives them concrete information that serves as a basis for their policymaking. This is also the case for resource management and other topics of importance such as the policies for innovation. Each year, PACE-Net also organised a large Pacific-Europe bi-regional platform dedicated to policy dialogue on science, technology and innovation cooperation.’&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;How will this connection between science and diplomacy evolve in the future?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘From a European point of view, I think the next steps will consist of consolidating a coordinated approach between scientific cooperation and development aid. In other words, between DG RTD (the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation) and DG DEVCO (the European Commission’s Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development).’&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Do you think that the seeds of this enhanced cooperation are already there?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘Yes, everything is there in the Pacific region. Everything is there for it to happen. We only need a few more actions and time to further implement it.’&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;So the Pacific is an environment where development science and aid can work effectively together?&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd&gt;‘Exactly. In the Pacific countries, we played that role by chance, by having with PACE-Net direct relationships with (government) organisations that didn’t know each other well. There was science on the one hand and development aid on the other hand. I will conclude by saying that the Pacific region in relation to Europe is prototypic. We can develop or find cooperation tools, and we can coordinate between different DGs and services from the European Commission over actions dedicated to the Pacific region, where things can be done on a human scale.’&lt;/dd&gt;

    <title>Regional Collaborations Programme</title>
    <link>http://plus.pacenet.eu/funding/regional-collaborations-programme</link>
    <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian Academy of Science invites Australian research organisations and businesses to apply for funding under the Regional Collaborations Programme. This funding initiative is part of the Australian Government&#039;s Global Innovation Strategy under the National Innovation and Science Agenda. The programme will fund Australian participants from eligible organisations to collaborate with regional and international science, research and innovation partners on solutions to shared regional challenges within the Asia–Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme is designed to be flexible, with no set minimum or maximum funding requirements for project applications. This approach has been adopted to help foster innovative ideas and collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no set minimum or maximum total project cost requirement, projects much include matched funding of 1:1 (cash only). For example, if an applicant seeks $25,000 of programme funding, then the project proponents would need to contribute another $25,000 (cash), bringing the total value of the project to $50,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $3.2 million four-year programme will support single-year or multi-year collaborative, multi-partner projects and non-project aligned collaborative workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme aims to support the Australian Government’s commitment to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;assist in the removal of barriers for researchers and businesses seeking to collaborate on issues of regional and national significance&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;support technical and research mobility&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;build research capability, facilitating Australia’s access to global science and research networks and infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are no mandated priority areas from which to draw research topics, please consider the national Science and Research Priorities and associated practical research challenges, along with regional challenges identified through multilateral fora such as eAsia, Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applicants must be either an Australian research organisation or Australian business willing to form collaborative multi-partner teams with participation from at least two other economies, with the intention of building strong international linkages within the Asia-Pacific region in science, research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-website field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org.au/opportunities/travel/grants-and-exchange/regional-collaborations-programme&quot;&gt;https://www.science.org.au/opportunities/travel/grants-and-exchange/regional-col...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Regional Collaborations Programme&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>The European Union’s Research and Innovation Programs: How is Horizon 2020 progressing?</title>
    <link>http://plus.pacenet.eu/events/european-union%E2%80%99s-research-and-innovation-programs-how-horizon-2020-progressing</link>

Furthermore, the EU seeks to involve researchers from all parts of the world, including Australia. &lt;a href=&quot;/horizon2020&quot;&gt;Horizon 2020&lt;/a&gt; is about to enter its fourth year, so it is now well established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seminar will provide an overview of how the implementation of Horizon 2020 is taking shape, with reference particularly to the opportunities for Australian researchers. There will be an update with respect to the progress of the current calls, and of the timetable for planning of the 2018-2020 Work Programme, as well as broader considerations such as Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seminar will be led by Dr Rado Faletič, a Director of &lt;a href=&quot;/partners/montroix&quot;&gt;Montroix Pty Ltd&lt;/a&gt; and formerly Executive Director of &lt;abbr title=&quot;Forum for European-Australian Science and Technology cooperation&quot;&gt;FEAST&lt;/abbr&gt; (the Forum for European-Australian Science and Technology cooperation). He is the Australia’s foremost expert on Horizon 2020, and will be available for more in-depth discussions both before and after this public seminar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;The European Union’s Research and Innovation Programs: How is Horizon 2020 progressing?&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

The allocated funds by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development is as in 2016, €1,500,000. The Pacific Fund could therefore co-fund approximately 40 projects, for an average of €30,000 per project. Any public or private body, institution, legal person can apply to this Fund).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among many other projects, in 2016 this grant scheme supported the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; PIURN Conference; the “Pacific business Forum”, a project of epidemiological surveillance of ciguatera, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-website field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Website:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/dossiers-pays/oceanie/la-france-et-l-oceanie/le-fonds-pacifique/article/fonds-pacifique-2017-appel-a-projets&quot;&gt;http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/dossiers-pays/oceanie/la-france-et-l-oceanie/le...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Pacific Fund 2017 call for projects&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rado Faletic, Director, Project &amp; Communication, of Montroix Pty Ltd said that Horizon 2020 was a means to drive economic growth and create jobs, and has the political backing of Europe’s leaders and the members of the European Parliament. They agreed that research is an investment in our future and so put it at the heart of the EU’s blueprint for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Faletic said that these programs have quick rules, with a proposal that should normally be focused on European interest. “Projects must involve a minimum of 3 different organizations from three separate European countries,” he said. “Exception to these rules is noted in the calls, especially calls focused on an individual researcher.” Dr Faletic said that a proposal must address the core requirements. “Most of the core rules are very specific and projects are not to fund pet topics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But these are to fund what Europe wants and also let your European colleagues do all the hard work. Third Countries organization can participate in most calls and get funded but you cannot do it by yourself, you must be part of a European consortium,” Dr Faletic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-website field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Further information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nus.edu.ws/s/index.php/87-nus/news-events/430-massive-european-union-research-funding-project-outlined-at-nus-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.nus.edu.ws/s/index.php/87-nus/news-events/430-massive-european-union-...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Massive European union research funding project outlined at NUS Conference&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>National Science Teachers Summer School (NSTSS) 2017</title>

Attending the NSTSS offers participating teachers the opportunity to engage in a professional dialogue about teaching and learning, and to explore methods of engaging students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Youth Science Forum (NYSF) has delivered the NSTSS for more than ten years, in collaboration with The Australian National University (ANU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the focus on STEM increasing in schools across the country, the NSTSS program is an opportunity for both new and experienced teachers to hear about the most up-to-date research in these fields, equipping them with the knowledge to not just teach their students, but to also inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;National Science Teachers Summer School (NSTSS) 2017&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>

    <title>Towards a Pacific ST&amp;I Agenda</title>
    <link>http://plus.pacenet.eu/news/pacific-agenda-2016</link>

To work towards this objective PACE-Net Plus has, amongst other activities, established a working group to identify pathways to raise the profile of Pacific research in order to enable such a dialogue. The dialogue seeks to enhance the relative strengths of the parties and to utilise these for developing their respective societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges in the culturally independent societies in the Pacific that can benefit from relevant community and national, as well as regionally coordinated, &lt;abbr title=&quot;science, technology and innovation&quot;&gt;ST&amp;amp;I&lt;/abbr&gt; initiatives, for example in the fields of &lt;a href=&quot;/wp1&quot;&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/wp2&quot;&gt;food security&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/wp3&quot;&gt;environment&lt;/a&gt;, observation systems, etc. There are also many opportunities to enhance sustainable responses to climate change given the unique position the Pacific has at the forefront of environmental change. Its isolation also serves to shield it from global impacts and serves as a way of testing and developing strategies for communities in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the project encourages the inclusion of &lt;abbr title=&quot;science, technology and innovation&quot;&gt;ST&amp;amp;I&lt;/abbr&gt; in national development strategies and the coordination of regional research towards common research strategies and related policies and programmes in the Pacific region by promoting the implementation of joint actions, based on a proposed agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document addresses regional leadership (including parliaments, communities, elders and CROP agencies) to develop a regional vision for &lt;abbr title=&quot;science, technology and innovation&quot;&gt;ST&amp;amp;I&lt;/abbr&gt; in the Pacific to enable them to define their joint future. This is a powerful tool for regional leadership to inform decision-making — that will impact on future generations — on national and regionally derived findings of scientific research. We invite the leadership to consider this document and adapt the ideas to their own circumstances, taking into account specific strengths and architectures of each community and nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-website field-type-link-field field-label-inline clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Further information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/system/files/documents/PNP%20Towards%20a%20Pacific%20STI%20Agenda%20v4.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://plus.pacenet.eu/system/files/documents/PNP%20Towards%20a%20Pacific%20STI%...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-og-group-ref field-type-entityreference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Groups audience:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp5&quot;&gt;WP5 Strengthening Pacific-EU Research Cooperation Partnerships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.pacenet.eu/wp6&quot;&gt;WP6 Bi-regional Policy Dialogue in ST&amp;amp;I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;- Private group -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span property=&quot;dc:title&quot; content=&quot;Towards a Pacific ST&amp;amp;I Agenda&quot; class=&quot;rdf-meta element-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description>
